Virtual Laboratory - Experiment 4: TF-IDF Based Document Retrieval
Course: Knowledge Graphs and Information Retrieval Systems 
Roll Nos: 16-20 | Group No: 4

Built on the standard 4-section Virtual Lab template:
  1. Theory: Concepts, objectives, procedure, and terminology.
  2. Simulation: Interactive TF-IDF retrieval sandbox with a live corpus/query engine.
  3. Quiz: Self-grading conceptual assessment with instant feedback.
  4. Report Generation: Student info, recorded trials, observations, and downloadable PDF report.

Note: No custom CSS is used so that Streamlit's native light and dark themes render seamlessly.
